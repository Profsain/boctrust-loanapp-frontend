        <p style={subTitle}>11. Subject Access Request Response Procedure</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a. Where you wish to exercise any of your data privacy rights you
            shall make a formal request by completing the Subject Access Request
            Form (SAR Form) and sending the completed form via email to us at
            privacy@boctrustmfb.com
          </li>
          <li>
            b. We shall contact you within 5 working days of the receipt of the
            SAR Form to confirm receipt of the subject access request and may
            request additional information to verify and confirm the identity of
            the individual making the request
          </li>
          <li>
            c. On receiving any request from you, we shall record the request
            and carry out verification of the identity of the individual making
            the request using the details provided in the SAR Form and a valid
            means of identification such as international passport, driver’s
            license, national identification card or any other acceptable means
            of identification
          </li>
          <li>
            d. Where the request is from a third party (such as relative or your
            representative), we will verify their authority to act for you and
            may contact you to confirm their identity and request your consent
            to disclose the information
          </li>
          <li>
            e. When your identity is verified, we shall coordinate the gathering
            of all information collected with respect to you in a concise,
            transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear
            and plain language with a view to responding to the specific
            request. The information may be provided in writing, or by other
            means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means or orally
            provided that your identity is proven by other means. We may also
            contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your
            request to speed up our response
          </li>
          <li>
            f. Where the information requested relates directly or indirectly to
            another person, we will seek the consent of that person before
            processing the request. However, where disclosure would adversely
            affect the rights and freedoms of others and we are unable to
            disclose the information, we will inform you promptly, with reasons
            for that decision
          </li>
          <li>g. Fees and Timeframe</li>
          <li>
            h. We shall ensure that we provide the information required by you
            within a period of one month from the receipt of the request.
            Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is
            particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
            case, we will notify you and keep you updated. However, where we are
            unable to act on your request, we shall inform you promptly at least
            within one month of receipt of the request of the reasons for not
            taking action and give you the option of lodging a complaint with
            the NITDA, in line with the NDPR
          </li>
          <li>
            i. Where the request relates to any perceived violation of your
            rights, we shall take appropriate steps to remedy such violations,
            once confirmed. Remedies shall include but not limited to the
            investigation and reporting to appropriate authorities, recovering
            the personal data, correcting it and/ or enhancing controls around
            it. You shall be appropriately informed of the remedies employed
          </li>
          <li>
            j. Any information provided to you by us shall be provided free of
            charge. However, where requests are manifestly unfounded or
            excessive in particular because of their repetitive or cumbersome
            nature, we may: Charge a reasonable fee taking into account the
            administrative costs of providing the information or communication,
            taking the action required or making a decision to refuse to act on
            the request; or Write a letter to you stating refusal to act on the
