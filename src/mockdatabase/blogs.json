      "content": "Imagine that low and moderate income consumers created the financial services of their dreams. How would they describe what they want from their financial services? Would the description resemble the services they actually receive? Customer wishes are actually pretty simple, whether customers are poor or not and whether they live in frontier, emerging, or high-income markets. First, they want services that help them accomplish goals and solve problems. Second, when they use those services they want a positive experience. When consumers speak about financial service experiences, they use words like confidence, safety, trust, and understanding – or their opposite: confusion, doubt, and stress. These words convey the serious emotional stakes involved in money matters. By contrast, financial service providers tend to use bloodless jargon like “addressable market”, “customer acquisition” or “user interface”. Providers must turn these business concepts into a customer experience that evokes confidence and affirmation.",

      "content": "Budgeting sounds like a boring strategy used by our parents. For a long time, budgeting was considered the way to manage money because it helped people keep track of where their finances were going. But lots of people are choosing not to budget because it seems so needlessly complicated with little or not benefit. But there is a benefit to budgeting; the real trick is finding a budgeting method that works for you. Here is an excellent strategy to help you manage the money in your personal portfolio. The first thing you need to do is create a budget. Creating a budget does not have to be restrictive, but it should be a guideline to help you manage your income and your expenses each month. The first thing you want to do is list all your expenses on a month-to-month basis. The next thing you want to do it list all of your income on a month-to-month basis. Then compare. Many people who have trouble saving find that their expenses are very close to their income. So what can you do?One option you have is to reduce your expenses. This might mean going out with friends a little less or giving up on some luxury that you typically enjoy. Another option you have is to increase your income. Unfortunately, for many people, this is easier said than done. One way that you can reduce your expenses and increase your income is by using a debt consolidation loan. By consolidating many outstanding debts that are due throughout the month into a single loan with a single monthly payment you will be accomplishing several things. First, you will be reducing your monthly payment because you will be securing a larger loan and is spread out over a longer period of time. Second, you’ll be reducing the amount of interest you pay because you will be consolidating your many debts into one debt from one provider. Reducing your interest not only helps to reduce your expenses but also increases your income! And if you are able to find some assets that can help you get a secured loan, you’ll be able to spread out your payment over a longer period of time and you will likely qualify for a lower interest rate because you have some security to offer the lending institution to back up the loan.Now that you are actively pursuing a budget, you will need to find a way to continue to reduce your expenses over time. A secured loan will help you do that. But don’t forget that there are many ways you can also increase your income.Congratulations! You are assembling a budget and getting control of your finances and at the same time you are reducing your expenses and increasing your income.",

      "content": "If you understand and follow the basic principle of “Cash is King” you can change your life forever. Your life will be less stressful financially and you will be taking your first major step toward “financial peace of mind”. “Cash is King” is an easy principle to understand; however it may be difficult to follow. This principle is the key to less stress within your financial life. Many things tell us how to manage our finances and it seems that none of them address the “root cause” of our financial problems. The biggest problem is that we live in a world of plastic and for all practical purposes we do not respect or understand the value of cash. If you follow this simple but different principle of “Cash is King” you will start on the road to “financial peace of mind”. Here are two basic suggestions on how to follow the principle of “Cash is King”: When you are paid make sure you allocate enough money to pay your rent/mortgage, utilities and any other fixed expenses you may have. Any amount of cash that is left should be withdrawn from your checking account to be used for food, clothing, gifts, entertainment, gas, etc. The best way for you to control this cash would be for you to divide and allocate certain amounts of cash for each variable expense and store this cash in labeled envelopes. Now remember that this cash is the only way you can spend. Once you have used all your cash there will be no spending until your next paycheck. This is tough! No credit/debit cards? You must be kidding! How will I ever get through to my next payday without using my credit/debit cards? They say smoking is hard to give up, I think sticking to the principle of “Cash is King” may even be harder! Stick with “Cash is King” and manage your money. You will start by finding the cheapest places to buy gas, run your errands more logically and take your food from home instead of buying that meat pie every day. You will have to find many new ways to manage your cash and the first few weeks will be the toughest. You may even run out of cash before your next payday, however, you will stick to the principle “Cash is King” and eventually find “financial peace of mind”. After several weeks it will get easier to manage your cash and you will be surprised to find extra cash available before your next paycheck. What will you do with that extra cash? Many say put the extra cash into a savings account or pay a little extra towards one of your debts. I say put it in a coffee can and let it accumulate then take yourself out and have one great party! If you can follow this principle, you will be on your way to establishing a personal/family budget. Let the BUDGET keeper SYSTEM show you the way to “financial peace of mind”.",
